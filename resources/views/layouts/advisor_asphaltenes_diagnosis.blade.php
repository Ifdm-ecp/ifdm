			The rock compressibility is defined as the fractional change in volume of the solid rock material (grains) with a unit change in pressure [2]. Hall's correlation: <br> <br>  <center>C = (1.87* (10^-6) * (Phi^(-0.415))</center> <br> Where C is rock compressibility, and Phi is the formation porosity.

		<div id="advisor_initial_porosity"><br>
			The porosity of a rock is a measure of the storage capacity (pore volume) that is capable of holding fluids. It is the ratio of the pore volume to the total volume (bulk volume). [2] Core analysis and well logs, are extensively used in evaluating the initial porosity.

		<div id="advisor_asphaltene_particle_diameter"><br>
			Asphaltene molecules can self-associate to aggregation particles due to several interactions. The particles are most commonly described as “nanoaggregrates” with their dimensions of 2–10 nm. The asphaltene nanoaggregates can further cluster in crude oils and toluene. At higher concentrations than the CNAC (critical nanoaggregate concentration), a secondary aggregation process known as the clustering of nanoaggregates takes place. These clusters can have a length scale of several nanometers. [5] It can be calculated through optical microscopy and high pressure SEM(Scanning Electron Microscope). It can be estimated with simulation by the "Yacimientos de hidrocarburos" group from the "Universidad Nacional sede Medellin"
