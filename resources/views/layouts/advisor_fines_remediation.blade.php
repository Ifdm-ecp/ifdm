		The module provides a volume of acid to be injected into the main stage of the acid stimulation treatment train.

	<div id="advisor_initial_porosity">
		<br>
		The porosity of a rock is a measure of the storage capacity (pore volume) that is capable of holding fluids. It is the ratio of the pore volume to the total volume (bulk volume). [1] Core analysis and well logs, are extensively used in evaluating the initial porosity.
	</div>

	<div id="advisor_initial_permeability">
		<br>
		Is a property of the porous medium that measures the capacity and ability of the formation to transmit fluids. [3] Core analysis and well logs, are extensively used in evaluating the initial permeability.
	</div>

	<div id="advisor_temperature">
		Temperature of the productive formation, it can be acquired using well logging.
	</div>

	<div id="advisor_well_radius">
		The wellbore section is assumed to be a circle and has a specific radius called the wellbore radius. It can be estimated by the production casing internal diameter, or the bit size.
	</div>

	<div id="advisor_damage_radius">
		Radius in which the greatest loss of permeability and porosity is found. It can be obtained from the module of diagnosis of damage due to migration and swelling of fines developed by the "Yacimientos de hidrocarburos" group from the "Universidad Nacional sede Medellin" 
	</div>

	<div id="advisor_net_pay">
		Net Pay is that part of the reservoir thickness which contributes to oil recovery. All available measurements performed on reservoir samples and in wells, such as core analysis and well logs, are extensively used in evaluating the reservoir net thickness. [1]
	</div>

	<div id="advisor_rock_compressibility">
		Geological data, rock property measured during exploration or perforation of the reservoir. Rock compressibility is the change of volume of the rock in response to a pressure gradient. Hall's correlation is a way to calculate it:   C = (1.87*(10^-6)*(Phi^(-0.415)), where C is rock compressibility, and Phi is the formation porosity.
	</div>

	<div id="advisor_pressure">
		The force exerted by fluids in a formation at the beginning of the production history. [3]
	</div>

	<div id="advisor_code_table_excel_damage_diagnosis">
		<p>Information of permeability, porosity and skin depending on the radius. It is a data that is brought from the software of diagnosis of damage by migration and swelling of fines.</p>

	<div id="advisor_acid_concentration">
		Concentration of the selected type of acid. It can be taken from the Selection Methodology software.
	</div>

	<div id="advisor_injection_rate">
		Acid injection rate
